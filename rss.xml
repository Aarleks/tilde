    <p>An important part of working with students on their assessment tasks is feedback. Students need detailed, specific comment on their work for the purposes of learning and self-improvement. While learning management systems serve this function, they tend to be clunky, anonymous, and unfriendly. Frequently, I need to send a document with written feedback and an annotated copy of the submission, and email is a good, simple tool for that.</p>
