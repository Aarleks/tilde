# Who am I

I'm Alex Norman

I'm a senior lecturer in the Graduate Research School at Western Sydney University where my primary role is directing the [Master of Research](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/graduate_research_school/grs/courses/master_of_research) programme and co-delivering its core units on writing for research, the sociology of research, and on public audience writing.

# My research

My research interest is generally around meaning, purpose, and identity. I'm mainly interested what I call [spiritual tourism](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/spiritual-tourism-9781441150448/) and in the sociological and cultural factors that affect travel involving visits to religious sites. With colleagues in the [Shamatha Project](http://saronlab.ucdavis.edu/shamatha-project.html) I also research the socio-bio-physical aspects of contemplative practices such as meditation. And with my colleague, Jack Tsonis, I'm researching [sauna practices](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/thri/research/health,_culture_and_society/sauna_studies).

In addition, my teaching duties the Master of Research have ignited a research interest in writing as a tool of thought, and in research itself as a thing humans do.

# While you're here

I'm in the process of starting to develop a collection of resources for researchers focussing on writing and data collection and analysis.

I'm mainly interested in free and open-source tools, and in plain text writing practices. In this I've been influenced by a people like:

* [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/)
* [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/)
* [Caleb McDaniel](http://wcaleb.org/)

If you have any suggestions for tools, resources, or stuff I should read, please let me know.

## A Zettelkasten with Vim

I've always struggled with categorising my notes. When I moved from paper to elecronic notes I started to struggle; I felt like I needed to 'file' things because that's what you did with files on a computer. You put them in folders.

The problem is my mind doesn't work in folders; it works more like a network. This problem was mostly solved when I discovered wiki-style note-taking. For this, I used [Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) which works excellently. But I wanted for a theory and method with which to use this tool. Enter Zettelkasten.

A Zettelkasten is a 'slip box'; or box of notes. The zettelkasten method was first described by sociologist, Thomas Luhrman, and recently developed for digital tools by Christian Tietze and Sascha Fast at [https://zettelkasten.de/](https://zettelkasten.de/). The basic idea is that you make notes and put them all into one folder. The structure comes from the links you make in the notes themselves to other notes in the folder.

Now that I've switched to [Vim](https://www.vim.org) for all my writing, I wanted to make sure I had a dedicated zettelkasten system within it. There are two good-looking zettelkastend plugins - [Notoire](https://github.com/KevinBockelandt/notoire) and [vim-zettel](https://github.com/michal-h21/vim-zettel), neither seemed to do exactly what I wanted. Also, I just wanted to write my own Vim plugin...

So, I give you [Zettel.vim](https://github.com/Aarleks/zettel.vim). It's a work-in-progress and very early days so far. But I'm hoping it can be a useful little plugin that sticks pretty close to vanilla Vim; the exceptions will be the use of [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and its accompanying Vim plugin for fuzzy search, and [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for searching file contents.
