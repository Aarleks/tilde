# tilde

Because I'm an insufferable hipster I've made a `tilde.club`-style site as a placeholder while I repair my main site.

Sorry.


## Things I may want to do

* add a rolling blog (including a drafts folder?);
* make the index page a bit more purposeful;
* add a resources page;
* add a teaching page;
* add a cv page;
* make a shell script to add, edit, and delete pages.
* add an rss capability
