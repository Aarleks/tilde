## A test post

This is a test of the standard blog post. What I'm hoping this will allow me to do is write posts and then run the blog update script to compile all the changes, push to Github, and transfer to my VPS.

> Ideally, I'd like to try and have the first few lines of the blog post appear on the home page above a list of older post titles. The list of older posts might be something like 10 posts long.

I'd also like to look into tags.

## Now a level-2 header

Some text for show.
